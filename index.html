<p>
I grew up in Stillwater, Minnesota, where I attended town-wide events such as Lumberjack Days, spent time tubing and hanging out on the St. Croix River, and played sports for the Stillwater Ponies.
My favorite sport to play was soccer, and I still play casually. I attended college, and graduated from Gustavus Adolphus with a degree in Business. I took time during those years to apply critical thinking skills, collaborate on projects, 
and explore a wide area of subjects. After graduation, I had the opportunity to live abroad for a year, in Barranquilla, Colombia, where I worked teaching English. The year still impacts me today, from speaking Spanish and having social media connections from South America, to 
an increased desire to travel and see new perspectives. Since then, I have had work experiences that include marketing, data analysis, and customer service in various industries and capacities. I am developing my coding skills because I enjoy problem solving, analyzing information, and the exponential possibilities
that can be created through technology.
